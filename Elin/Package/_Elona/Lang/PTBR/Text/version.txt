{topic, 关于中国区Elin的价格变动通知}
大家好，我是noa。

非常感谢各位能热情的在发售首日购买、支持Elin。

由于对各个地区的定价情况了解不足，我在接到玩家对首发定价的意见后，于11/2日对中国区Elin的价格进行了适当的调整。对因价格调整引起的差价，我会在后续进行补偿，具体补偿方案将会在今后进行公布。

您可通过在游戏内的控制台输入「FirstAdventurer」，查看是否拥有获得首发购买特典的资格。

根据Steam的商品购买条例，实际游玩时间未满2小时的玩家均可对游戏进行退款操作，具体操作方法可咨询Steam客服。

{topic, 关于中文版的翻译}
关于中文的翻译，目前游戏的更新频率较为频繁，而更新内容到完成翻译还需要一定时间，所以会出现游戏更新后显示一部分未翻译内容的情况。

我今后会推出完全翻译的版本，来保证玩家获得最好的游戏体验。

* Added high-quality appraisal as a level bonus for the appraisal skill.
* Display sorting settings within containers in tents as well.
* Feather scrolls can now be used on artifacts.

* Various other minor fixes and adjustments.

[Notes]
* Creating a field and digging with a shovel yields soil of that type, currently available in unlimited quantity.

* If movement is blocked by an obstacle, self-harm may occasionally trigger teleportation.
* Piety is a hidden value.
* If unable to speak with Fiamma or Ash, it’s likely they are angry and neutral. Try talking through the middle-click menu, kill them temporarily, or allowing a few days to pass.
